# Itches
--------------

Itches is essentially a Scratch-like language that can be used in the terminal.
Of course, this means commands rather than drag-and-drop, but hopefully 
tab-complete can be implemented.

## Command Ideas

Commands to be structured as `Category.Command`.

### Categories

*	Control	(Control Blocks)
*	Move	(Motion)
*	Look	(Appearance)
*	Variable	(Data - lists covered too)
*	Maths	(Mathematical/Bitwise logical operators)
*	Compare	(Comparison logical operators)
*	Pen	(Drawing)
*	Sense	(Sensing)
*	Sub	(Subroutine blocks)
*	Extended?	(Additional block types for extensions?)
*	etc...

## Tools

Need to create an ANSI/ASCII "image" editor!
