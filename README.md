# Itches
--------------

Itches is essentially a Scratch-like language that can be used in the terminal.
Of course, this means commands rather than drag-and-drop, but hopefully 
tab-complete can be implemented.

## Command Ideas

Commands to be structured as `Category.Command`.

### Categories

*	Control
*	Move
*	Look
*	Variable
*	Maths
*	Compare
*	etc...
